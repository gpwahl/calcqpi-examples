Minimal examples for calcQPI

This is a repository of minimal tight-binding models to demonstrate the capabilities of calcQPI in calculating QPI patterns. The minimal models test a range of functionalities of calcQPI, including calculation of surface states, Rashba spin splitting, topogically protected surface states, nearest neighbour tight-binding models on square and hexagonal lattices, and calculations of Bogoljubov quasi-particle interference.
